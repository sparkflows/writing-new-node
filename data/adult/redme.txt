Dataset Review
The Adult dataset we are going to use is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This data derives from census data, and consists of information about 48842 individuals and their annual income. We will use this information to predict if an individual earns >50k a year or <=50K a year. The dataset is rather clean, and consists of both numeric and categorical variables.
